"""
Event processing constructs at par to Edh's

The channel construct here is similar to STM's broadcast TChan, see:
  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/stm/docs/Control-Concurrent-STM-TChan.html
While no unicast TChan needed here, the design is simplified to PubChan and
SubChan.

For intuition:
    *) PubChan can be thought of as the write-only broadcast TChan.
    *) SubChan can be thought of as the TChan dup'ed from a broadcast TChan,
       which will only ever be read.

Like a broadcast TChan, a PubChan itself is not buffering items, when there is
no SubChan reading its item stream, any item written to the PubChan is
discarded immediately.

Like you can dup multiple TChan from a broadcast TChan, you can create multiple
SubChan from a common PubChan, then have them consuming items from the common
PubChan concurrently.

A SubChan's buffer is unbounded, so here's a caveat that slow consumers with a
faster producer will constantly increase the program's memory footprint, i.e.
items will pile up in memory.
